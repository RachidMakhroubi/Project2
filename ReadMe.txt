Tips:
When comparing result with calculator on zillow.com, make sure that:
number of months/weeks (in this app) /12 = number of years (in zillow)
monthly/weekly interest rate (in this app) *12 = yearly interest (in zillow)

Notice that weekly and montly payment are treated the same in this app. 
The difference will show when a payment calendar is displayed (not implemented in this app)
-------------------------------------------------------------
To improve:
1. When weekly or monthly button is selected, the other input part should be disabled.
2. After switching payment term, user must move the correct seek bar a little bit to trigger refresh. 
3. Increase precision of interest rate.
